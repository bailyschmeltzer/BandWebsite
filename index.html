      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Neon Oblivion is a hard-hitting rock and metal cover duo bringing raw power and electrifying energy to every 
        performance. Formed by two musicians with a shared passion for the genre’s most iconic heavyweights, we channel 
        the spirit of bands like Metallica, Linkin Park, Rage Against the Machine, Ghost, and more—reviving the anthems 
        that defined generations and reimagining them with our own edge. Whether it’s the crushing riffs of thrash, 
        the aggressive grooves of nu-metal, or the theatrical punch of modern rock, our mission is simple: to make 
        every set unforgettable. We don't just play the songs—we relive them, with the same intensity and emotion 
        that made them legendary. Currently based Columbus Ohio, Neon Oblivion is all about stripped-down, high-impact 
        performances that prove two people can still make a stadium-sized sound.
